### Why test orientation effects across languages

>- Inconsistent findings among languages
>- Mysterious implication: Language Comprehension X Actions
>- Update researchers' scope

## Issues

>- **Mental Simulation**: Our minds simulate what we are reading.
>- **Match Advantage**: (Check example)Faster responses to the object pictures which are compatible with our simulations.

----

### Why the orientation effect has the smallest effect size?

- Theory issues
  - Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic
  - Diversity among languages
- Methodology issues
  - Only small objects were employed in the investigation of orientation effect
  - Task demands: Verification only?

## Registered Report

<iframe class="stretch" data-src="https://psyarxiv.com/a3vwc/"></iframe>

----

### Investigate match advantage of object orientation between ...

- Large objects vs. Small objects: **crane** vs. **cane**
- **Tasks** Picture Verification vs. Pictures Comparison vs. Picture Naming
- Languages: English vs. Dutch(Dutch; English) vs. Chinese


----

### Pre-analysis for sample size estimation

- Estimate maximal sample size in terms of past results and .80 power
- Decide Bayes Factor for stopping data collection

----

## Findings

----

### About picture verification

![](D:/core/Research/projects/Embodied/EXPDATA/ActionObject/2016_Simulation/report/Stage2_main_files/figure-latex/study1-meta-1.png)

----

### About picture identification

![](D:/core/Research/OpenSci/Public/PSA_Orientation/includes/img/PP.png)

----

### About picture naming

- No language group shows match advantage of object orientation.
- Naming small objects was faster than naming large objects.

## Conclusion

- Orientation effects shifted with object size and task demands
- Moderator of languages

# Orientation effects across languages

----

### Why PSA accept this project

>- Timing
>- Significance </br>
   Members share the interest with mine </br>
   Accumulated evidence would provoke new research topic
>- Feasibility </br>
  Members could run this project with the limited resource  </br>
  Members could afford the estimated sample size 

----

## Confirmation and Exploration

>- **Language Diversity**: Finding robust orientation effect in addition to Amenrican English?
>- **Embodied Cognition**: Studies tested extended hypothesis in terms of small effect size

----

>- How would language alter match advantage of object orientation?

# Before propose my collaborative project

- All collaborators for my project

## Is my plan global?

- Many researchers share your interests to your plan.
- Your plan would gather the collaborators who want to conduct the studies like yours.

## How global is my plan ?

- Do meta-research for your plan
- Join the collaborative project close to your research interest
- StudySwap

# How to propose my first  collaborative project

- One collaborator for all my studies

## Challenges (for local sites)

- Limited resource
- Only a few researchers share the interest with you
- Your fellows have no motivation toward open sciences

## Opportunities (for local sites)

- Explore new research topics
- Share experience
- Upgrade scientific scope

## Advantages (for sciences)

- Investigate **psychological effects** which could be diverse among cultures, langauges, societies, and any human traits.
- Accumulate the reproducible data in science literature.

## Thoughts and Recommendations

- Do what you like
- Improve your standard of research quality
- Think about the global potential of your local study
